# Extra Credit:  Deploying your app to Heroku.
Once you have a flask app running locally on your machine already, you can then try to make a live website that anyone can visit by depolying it to Heroku.  

These instructions were adapted from [this tutorial blog](https://blog.cambridgespark.com/deploying-a-machine-learning-model-to-the-web-725688b851c7). 

1. Sign up for a free Heroku account at https://signup.heroku.com/signup/dc
2. You should all already have git installed, so you can skip this step. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.
3. For Mac Users: [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you dont have it already. (Window users can skip this step.)
4. Install the [Heroku CLI tool](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).  Mac users need homebrew to install Heroku, Window users dont need it to install Heroku.

### STEP 1: Create a github repo with your webapp files.
__(You should already have this step completed, but if you dont, you need to add your files to a github repo.)__ 
1. Create a github repo for your app.
2. Clone that repo to your local machine. 
3. Git add, commit, and push the webapp files to your repo. 
Now you should have a github repo that contains all the files you need for your web app, now we need to link, push, and deploy them onto heroku. Your github repo should look [something like this](https://github.com/zd123/zd-flask-app).

### STEP 2: Create and push files to Heroku.
1. Make sure you have followed the instructions above for installing the Heroku CLI and git to your machine first. 
2. From your github repo folder, in your terminal, type in `heroku login`.  Follow the login instructions. 
3. Next create your app using `heroku create your-webapp-name`.  Replace 'your-webapp-name' with the app name you would like to use.  It will be a part of your final URL. 
4. Then, add your git to heroku by using `heroku git:remote -a your-webapp-name`.  Again, replace 'your-webapp-name' with the name you used above to create your app. 
5. Finally, push your files to heroku by using `git push heroku HEAD:master`
After you push your files to heroku, it should spit out a link to your webapp, it will look something like, `https://web-app-name.herokuapp.com/`

___
### Making changes to your app. 
Say you've updated your webapp files now want to update your hosted webapp. 
1. Add, commit, and push all the changes to your github repo.
2. Run the `git push heroku HEAD:master` command.
